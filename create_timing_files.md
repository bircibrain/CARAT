Creating Timing Files
=====================

One of the most important parts of task-related fMRI is making sure you have the time course of the stimuli set. We will be extracting the stimulus timings from the .edf files generated by the Eyelink system.

## Step 0: Creating a DataViewer session.

1. Import all the data you want to analyze. 
	a.	File > Import Data > Multiple Data Filesâ€¦
2.	Save the DataViewer session.

## Step 1: Adding ScannerPulseTime variable to DataViewer.

In this step, we are extracting a timestamp that corresponds with when the scanner started for each subject. Then, we will add that variable to DataViewer to make it easier to export. 

1.	Find SessionData files:
	*	Look in the folder where you put your saved DataViewer session.
	*	Open the folder ending in .res
	*	Open the Session\_Data folder
2.	Copy all SessionData files into a folder containing the following scripts:
	*	`extract_onset.py`
	*	`onsets.sh`
3.	Open `onsets.sh` in a text editor (I prefer [TextWrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)) and edit line 9 to include the subjects you want to analyze.
	*	Make sure there is a space between each subject number
	*	e.g. `04 05 06 07`
4.	In Terminal, run the following command:
	*	`sh onsets.sh`
