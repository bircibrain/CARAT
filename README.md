# CARAT

Welcome to the github repository for the CARAT project. Here you will find scripts and documentation to help you process and analyze fMRI data.

Here is a list of the documentation that is available:

1. **[Creating timing files](./create_timing_files.md)**  
This file will tell you how to create timing files from raw EDF (eyetracker) output. Timing files are necessary to run the preprocessing and first-level statistical analysis.
2. **[Preprocessing](./preprocessing.md)**  
Preprocessing takes your raw imaging data (DICOM format) and timing information and creates subject-level statistical maps that can be used for the second-level analysis.
